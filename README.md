# Rock-paper-scissors
(Python) A simple game of rock, paper, scissors! The program will choose one of the choices randomly. See how many wins you can stack up.  


## Rules:
- Rock crushes Scissors.
- Paper covers Rock.
- Scissors cuts Paper.
- Same selection (e.g, Rock vs Rock) = Draw.

Happy coding.
